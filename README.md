# Bambu-Lab-Klipper-Conversion
Running Klipper on a Bambu Lab machine by replacing it's internal electronics with readily available open-source hardware.

Welcome to my page! The goal of this project is to have a fully non-destructive upgrade path to Klipper, on a Bambu Lab P1S. This means replacing the existing electronics with open-source hardware. My project right now is in the works, but should be fully working hopefully soon. Stick around for updates!
