# Bambu Lab Klipper Conversion!

Welcome to my page! The goal of this project is to have a **fully non-destructive** upgrade path to [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), on a Bambu Lab P1S. This means replacing the existing electronics with open-source hardware. My project right now is in the works, but should be fully working hopefully soon. Stick around for updates!

# "But why, what is the point of this?"

To start.. Why the hell not?! Putting open-source hardware and firmware on a closed source printer is hilarious. But for me personally there are so many benefits. All of my printers at the moment all run on Klipper, using the same exact Web UI. I'm familiar with it, I enjoy using it and I enjoy being able to make easy simple changes with a quick change of a text file. So adding Klipper onto my P1S is absolutely worth it to me. Once I get my heated bed to work, I will be able to run it at higher temperatures than 100c (It's an AC bed, it being software limited is absolutely ridiculous as it is the same bed that is used on a X1C)

My P1S has always struggled to print filaments like ABS and ASA without warping severely. And having Klipper on it means that I can also start adding other hardware to help. Such as a PTC heater to actively heat up the chamber. Adding a chamber thermistor to actually monitor to temperature inside. Adding a touchscreen onto the printer so that the horrible display before it no longer has to be used. The list can really go on and on!

# "How hard is it to convert?"

Not hard at all! The cost is super low, and since it's non destructive, everything is basically just drop in and go!

# Here are some images of the project thus far.
